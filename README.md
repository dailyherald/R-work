# Rstats
Learning how to do things with R stats. 
Currently going through the basic Swirl course while viewing "R programming A-Z" at Udemy.
FWIW, they seem to compliment each other quite well.


#### Installing R

To get R, go to 
https://www.r-project.org/ 

Once that's installed, get the free version of R-studio here 
https://www.rstudio.com/ 
You can run R without R-studio. But R-studio is a friendlier interface for R, and most people recommend it.

#### Learning R

Swirl is a set of interactive - free - tutorials that will take you through the basics of learning R and R-studio.  http://swirlstats.com/  To install it, type: `install.packages("swirl")` in the R console. It'll download and install it for you. 

To run swirl, type: `library(swirl)` and that will activate the tutorials.

I'm also going through this Udemy class: https://www.udemy.com/r-programming/ I find it to be a nice compliment to the swirl tutorials.
