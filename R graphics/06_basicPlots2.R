     ylab="Use of force incidents only")
# Now we're going to subset the data by the year 2014
y2014 <- subset(df, years==2014)
# And add that subset to the plot, with the color of red and
# as a solid cirlce (pch=19)

# to learn more, don't forget you can use Rstudio's built in query tool
# simply type ?points 

# Now we do the same with the other two years
y2015 <- subset(df, years==2015)

# Note that legends can be tricky. You have to leave room for them so they
# don't obscure the data. That means you may need to adjust the scales of your
# graphic beyond what it defaults to. Not something we need to worry about now

# Let's add the regression line
abline(lm(df$UOF_only~df$Total_RTR_incidents))

# note that I needed to play around a bit with the size for the PDF
# generally, a little under 4 inches corresponds to a 2 column graphic
# but due to the legend, the depth needed to be increased so the 
# dots wouldn't run into the legend

# for online, 600 pixels wide is a good width for a png.
# anything wider and it might not work well for mobile.
# These basic graphics aren't great for presentation though
# when we start playing with ggplot2 we'll get closer
# to more finished graphics
