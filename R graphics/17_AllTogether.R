# Let's start by taking a look at the data 

library(readr)
df <- read_csv("ElginUOF.csv")
summary(df)


# What we're looking at is three years of data, by quarter,
# showing how many times officers had to use physical force
# to restrain suspects, how many times they used a taser or gun
# and how many times an officer or suspect was injured

# This isn't a big dataset - there are very few rows and columns
# But that means it's also easy to understand what we're seeing
# When you start working with data that has 100s of rows and columns
# these same techniques are going to be vital to understanding 
# what you have

# Right off the bat, I can see I need to create a column that
# only has years. I don't know if I'm going to use it or not, 
# but I want it.

# first I sort the data by the Year_Quarter
df[order(df$Year_Quarter),]
df

# let's create a vector of only the years and load it into a matrix
elgYears <- c(2014,2014,2014,2014,2015,2015,2015,2015,2016,2016,2016,2016)
years <- matrix(elgYears,12,1)
years

# Now let's bind the years matrix with our df so we have a column of just years
df <- cbind(years,df)

# look at df and you can see that we've got a column of years now

#--------
# There are some interesting columns in there, but I want to answer
# a question: As use of physical force increased, do injuries for officers
# and suspects also increase?

# In order to work with this, I'm going to need to create a new 
# dataset and create at least one new column

# Let's create the new column. For Response to resistance, we have
# show of force only, which is basically a warning
# use of force only, which is an officer using physical technique
# like a hold, in response to resistance
# and then transition, which includes both showing and using
# But we don't have total instances where force was used.
# to do that, we need to add up transition and use of force
# and put that into a new column, we'll call it force

df$force <- df$UOF_only + df$Total_transitions
# Check DF and we can see it's at the end

# now let's create our dataset
names(df)
dfLook <- subset(df, select = c("years","Year_Quarter","force","Total_officer","Total_suspect"))
dfLook

# cool, but I've thought of another thing. Total injuries
# include major and minor injuries. Let's add those to our new df

dfLook$Officer_major <- df$Officer_mayor
dfLook$Suspect_major <- df$Suspect_major

# Now we have a smaller chunk of data to work with. let's save it
write_csv(dfLook,"dfLook.csv")

summary(dfLook)

# Putting data you want to examine into its own df
# makes it far easier to manage. Now using summary we
# can see, for instance, that suspects get hurt more often than
# than officers, but offers have experience major
# injuries slightly more often.



library(ggplot2)

qplot(force,Total_officer,
      data=dfLook, 
      color=factor(years),
      xlab="UOF incidents", 
      ylab="officer injuried") + 
  facet_grid(. ~ factor(Officer_major))

qplot(force,Total_suspect,
      data=dfLook, 
      color=factor(years),
      xlab="UOF incidents", 
      ylab="suspect injuried") + 
  facet_grid(. ~ factor(Suspect_major))

# so right now we can see that major injuries aren't
# a defining factor. They don't happen frequently
# and they don't usually happen when UOF incidents
# are more frequent
