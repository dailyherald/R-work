# right off the bat, there's a problem with the 
# year, quarter labels. it's taking the index number
# of the row and we can't assign labels in the basic plot
# We also can't set x and y ranges

# To overcome this, we have to build the chart
# in steps

# first we set the x and y range
# x range equal the number of rows in Year_Quarter
# NROW all caps counts those

xrange <- range(1,NROW(df$Year_Quarter))
xrange
# then we need the greater of either SOF, UOF or Transitions
# Range finds that for us
yrange <- range(0,df$SOF_only,df$UOF_only,df$Transitions)
yrange

# set up the plot with x and y range, n = no chart type
# and axes = false
plot(xrange, yrange, type="n", axes=FALSE,
     xlab = "Year, Quarter", ylab = "Incidents",
     main = "Total RTR incidents")

# add the lines individually
# line type is b, or lines and dots
# pch is a filled dot, lwd is line size of 2 (1 is default)

# now add the axis - x first (1)
# las = 1 (labels horizontal)
# at is the number of ticks, which is the second number in
# xrange. So ticks from 1 to 12
axis(1, las=1, at=1:xrange[2], 
     tck = .05, # set the ticks to be inside plot
     # Since we're creating custom labels, we need 12 of them
