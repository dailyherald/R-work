#----Set up plot for print and online --------

# widths for pdf and png files are set up so that
# text elements work for print and online. 
# Generally, the pdf will = a 2-column graphic
# that in a pinch could be used in the paper without
# any work on my part as long as it printed in color,
# and the png will be readable on mobile.

# As for height, adjust that as necessary. Look at the
# files you create and see if they need room!

# While working out your plot, leave these items commented out
# so you can see a preview of your graphic in the plots pane
# when you're satisfied with it, then uncomment to save out
# files. Note you can't create pdfs and pngs at the same time
# you'll have to uncomment one and comment out the other.
