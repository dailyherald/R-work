# A boxplot is something that shows the range of data
# in a set. Basically it divides the most common 
# data into four parts with equal counts of data,
# or quartiles. Bottom and top quartiles are shown 
# by the extent of the top and bottom lines,
# while the two middle quartiles are boxed with the
# median as the line in the box. 
# Any points beyond the box and lines are considered
# potential outliers. So basically, it's showing
# that most of the data or predicted data would be between
# the box and lines, and trying to show what would 
# fall outside that prediction.
