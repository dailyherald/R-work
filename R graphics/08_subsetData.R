# I know I'm very used to the excel way of working
# where there are multiple columns of data.
# Instead, R (and other programs that do this kind of thing)
# wants a single column of data with other columns that 
# describe the data.

# You'll encounter often this as you progress 
# so it's just a matter of getting used to it
